Simple to use profile plugin allowing front-end login, user registration and edit profile by using shortcodes.
 
== Description ==

**Profile Builder is WordPress user registration done right.**

It lets you customize your website by adding a front-end menu for all your users, 
giving them a more flexible way to modify their user profile or register new users (front-end user registration). 
Users with administrator rights can customize basic user fields or add custom user fields to the front-end forms.

To achieve this, simply create a new page and give it an intuitive name(i.e. Edit Profile).
Now all you need to do is add the following shortcode: [wppb-edit-profile].
Publish the page and you are done!

= Front-end User Registration, Login, Edit Profile and Password Recovery Shortcodes =
You can use the following shortcode list:

* **[wppb-edit-profile]** - to grant users front-end access to their profile (requires user to be logged in).
* **[wppb-login]** - to add a front-end login form.
* **[wppb-register]** - to add a front-end register form.
* **[wppb-recover-password]** - to add a password recovery form.

Users with administrator rights have access to the following features:

* drag & drop to reorder user profile fields
* enable **Email Confirmation** (on registration users will receive a notification to confirm their email address).
* allow users to **Log-in with their Username or Email**
* enforce a **minimum password length** and **minimum password strength** (using the default WordPress password strength meter)
* assign users a specific role at registration (using **[wppb-register role="desired_role"]** shortcode argument for the register form)
* redirect users after login (using **[wppb-login redirect="www.example.com"]** shortcode argument)
* add register and lost password links below the login form (using **[wppb-login register_url="www.example.com" lostpassword_url="www.example.com"]** shortcode arguments)
* customizable login widget
* add a custom stylesheet/inherit values from the current theme or use the default one built into this plugin.
* chose which user roles view the admin bar in the front-end of the website (Admin Bar Settings page).
* select which profile fields users can see/modify.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I navigated away from Profile Builder and now I can�t find it anymore; where is it? =

	Profile Builder can be found in the default menu of your WordPress installation below the �Users� menu item.
